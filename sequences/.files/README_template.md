# Yeast pathway kit promoter and terminator vectors

This table contain a total of {number_of_tps} regulatory sequences cloned in a total of {number_of_vectors} vectors based on 
the [pYPKa](files/pYPKa.gb) vector. Inserts are intergenic sequences from S. cerevisiae tandemly 
expressed genes, so they can function as both promoters and terminators. 

Sequences were cloned  in either the [ZraI](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/ZraI.html)
or the [EcoRV](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/EcoRV.html) site to function as promoters or terminators, respectively.

Plasmids with an insert in [ZraI](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/ZraI.html) are named
pYPKa_Z_* (promoters) and plasmids with an insert in [EcoRV](http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/enz/EcoRV.html) are named
pYPKa_E_* (terminators).

Each vector is described using [pydna](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0544-x) 
in a [Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org).
